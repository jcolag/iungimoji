# iungimoji
A generator for simple memory games

I felt the urge to throw together a quick daily "memory" or "concentration" game, and...this is it.  *Iungo* is Latin for "join" or "connect," and *iungi* appears to be the first-person conjugation of the verb.  So, the goal is to connect matching emoji.

The `iungimoji.js` script generates a random board (`game.html`), with hidden pairs of emoji scrambled throughout.  It tracks the number of clicks and the time to complete the puzzle.
